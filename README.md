# Pantry-Party
---
##The Problem
------
The problem we are looking to solve is the burden, confusion, and stigma of meal prepping on oneâ€™s own. Oftentimes, individuals buy repeated items and have to throw out the food they already have at home. Or they may find that a load of groceries are too heavy or cumbersome to travel home with. With the current pandemic, we were thinking about making the most of what one has at home and find creative ways to interact with others - even while remote - to cook a meal collaboratively. 

##The Solution
------
Our app would allow users to input all food items perishable and non-perishable into a digital food pantry. Users would be able to keep track of their shopping list once purchased, the item now appears on the digital pantry. In order to make our app stand out, there will be a feature where users can find recipes and follow an interactactive cooking video for recipes that the user will be following. Pantry Party allows users to virtually interact with others and cook a meal at home while synchronously updating their digital pantry - giving them access to real time data before having to go to a grocery store without a plan.
